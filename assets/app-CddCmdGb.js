<h2>1. 概述</h2>
<p>在应用程序中使用数据库时，我们通常需要处理不再有用的记录的删除。然而，由于业务或法规要求，例如数据恢复、审计追踪或引用完整性目的，我们可能需要隐藏这些记录而不是删除它们。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将了解Hibernate的@SoftDelete注解并学习如何实现它。</p>
<h2>2. 理解@SoftDelete注解</h2>
<p>**@SoftDelete注解提供了一种方便的机制来标记任何记录为活动状态或已删除状态。**它有三个不同的配置部分：</p>

<li>**策略配置是跟踪活动行还是已删除行。**我们可以通过将_strategy_设置为_ACTIVE_或_DELETED_来配置它。</li>
<li>**指示器列确定将使用哪个列来跟踪行。**如果没有指定列，则策略使用默认列（<em>active_或_deleted</em>）。</li>
<li>**转换器定义了指示器列在数据库中的设置方式。**领域类型是一个布尔值，指示记录是活动状态还是已删除状态。然而，通过实现_AttributeConverter_，我们可以将关系类型设置为转换器定义的任何类型。可用的转换器有_NumericBooleanConverter_、<em>YesNoConverter_和_TrueFalseConverter</em>。</li>

<p>一个常见的误解是，获取字符串的镜像反射仅仅涉及反转其顺序。以字符串“ALL”为例。直观上，人们可能会期望它的镜像反射是“LLA”。然而，通过实际使用镜子仔细检查，我们发现“LLA”并不符合“ALL”的镜像版本。</p>
<p>关键的误解在于，字符串中的<strong>每个单独字符在其镜像反射中都会发生反转</strong>。因此，“ALL”的镜像反射实际上看起来像“⅃⅃A”。</p>
<p>字符可以根据其反转行为被归类为对称或不对称。<strong>对称字符是指在反转时保持不变的字符</strong>，例如‘A’、‘O’、‘o’、‘V’、‘v’、‘M’、‘8’、‘+’、‘-’等。相反，不对称字符与其反转形式不同，例如‘L’、‘S’、‘p’、‘h’、‘/’、‘3’等。</p>`,r:{minutes:3.26,words:977},t:"检查字符串是否等于其镜像反射",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-22/2024-06-22-Collect%20Stream%20of%20entrySet%20%20%20to%20a%20LinkedHashMap.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-22-Collect Stream of entrySet   to a LinkedHashMap.html-Bbct7KHL.js"),__vite__mapDeps([39,1])),meta:{d:17190144e5,l:"2024年6月22日",c:["Java","Tutorial"],g:["LinkedHashMap","Stream","Java 8"],e:`

<h1>在Spring Boot分页查询方法中一次性获取所有结果</h1>

<p>在本教程中，我们将<strong>学习多种方法来从整数范围 <em>[1-N]</em> 的数组中找出单个缺失的数字</strong>。</p>
<h2>2. 理解场景</h2>

<h2>1. 概述</h2>
<p>在这篇简短的教程中，我们将阐明如何解决Hibernate查询异常：“命名参数未绑定”。</p>

<h2>2. 理解异常</h2>
<p>在跳转到解决方案之前，让我们尝试理解异常及其堆栈跟踪的含义。</p>
<p>简而言之，Hibernate抛出_QueryException_来表示在将Hibernate查询转换为SQL时由于无效语法而出现错误。因此，堆栈跟踪中的“命名参数未绑定”表示Hibernate无法绑定在特定查询中指定的命名参数。</p>

<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p>在Java 8发布之后，Streams成为了Java不可或缺的一部分。它们是处理数据的强大而优雅的手段。因此，有时我们可能需要将流中的元素转换为Map或Multimap。</p>

<h2>2. 将Stream转换为Map</h2>
<h3>2.1. 使用Collectors.toMap()</h3>

<p>在Java中使用_Strings_有时会令人困惑，因为我们有多种方法来完成相似的事情。</p>

<p>让我们从isEmpty()这个String操作开始。简单来说，isEmpty()方法如果String为空，则返回true；否则返回false。</p>
<p>内部地，isEmpty()依赖于表示String对象文本的字节数组的长度。<strong>此外，isEmpty()方法计算文本是否为空时会计算任何类型的字符</strong>。因此，空格、制表符、新行或任何可以表示为一个字节的字符都被视为有效字符。</p>`,r:{minutes:3.24,words:973},t:"Java中String的isEmpty()与isBlank()的区别",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-27/2024-06-27-Differences%20Between%20%20%20and%20%20%20in%20Cron%20Expressions.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-27-Differences Between   and   in Cron Expressions.html-BovNYSyX.js"),__vite__mapDeps([246,1])),meta:{d:17194464e5,l:"2024年6月27日",c:["Java","Quartz"],g:["Cron表达式","定时任务"],e:`

<h3>1. 概述</h3>
<h3>2. 分区内的顺序及其挑战</h3>
<p>Kafka通过为每条消息分配一个唯一的偏移量来在单个分区内保持顺序。这保证了在该分区内消息的顺序追加。然而，当我们扩展并使用多个分区时，保持全局顺序就变得复杂了。不同的分区以不同的速率接收消息，这使得跨分区的严格排序变得复杂。</p>

<h3>2.1. for循环</h3>
<p>我们可以使用一个简单的for循环来迭代字符串的字符。这种方法的时间复杂度为O(n)，其中n是字符串str的长度，空间复杂度为O(1)，因为它只要求一个单独的循环变量：</p>

<h2>1. 引言</h2>

<h2>2. wait()的工作原理</h2>
<p>首先，我们需要简要讨论一下Java中wait()的工作原理。根据JLS，Java中每个对象都有一个监视器。基本上，这意味着我们可以对我们喜欢的任何对象进行同步。这可能不是一个很好的决定，但这就是我们现在所拥有的。</p>
<p>有了这个，当我们调用wait()时，我们隐式地做了两件事。首先，我们将当前线程放入JVM内部等待集，用于这个对象监视器。第二，一旦线程进入等待集，我们（或者说JVM）释放了这个对象的同步锁。在这里，我们需要澄清——这个词this指的是我们调用wait()方法的对象。</p>`,r:{minutes:4.12,words:1235},t:"为什么wait()需要同步？ | Baeldung",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-28/2024-06-28-Wrapping%20a%20String%20After%20a%20Number%20of%20Characters%20Word%20Wise.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-28-Wrapping a String After a Number of Characters Word Wise.html-UV17Nii2.js"),__vite__mapDeps([313,1])),meta:{d:17196192e5,l:"2024年6月29日",c:["Java","编程"],g:["字符串","换行"],e:`

<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p>在本教程中，我们将专注于Java对字符串插值的解决方案，即字符串模板。这个预览版特性作为JEP 430的一部分，被引入到Java 21中。</p>
<h2>2. Java中的字符串组合</h2>
<p>我们在代码中使用_字符串_来表示数字、字母和符号的序列作为文本。_字符串_在编程中无处不在，我们经常需要组合字符串以在代码中使用。有几种方法可以做到这一点，每种技术都有其缺点。</p>
<h3>2.1. 字符串连接</h3>
<p>字符串连接是我们用来构建字符串的最基本操作。我们采用字符串字面量和表达式，然后使用_+_符号将它们组合在一起：</p>

<p><strong>Telegram机器人是在Telegram消息平台内运行的自动化程序</strong>。它使用Telegram Bot API与用户互动并执行各种任务。我们将使用Java库而不是直接与API交互。机器人帮助我们响应用户命令，提供信息，并执行自动化操作。</p>
<p>我们将从设置一个全新的机器人开始，然后描述如何使用Java库来实现简单的操作。</p>
<p>首先，我们需要在Telegram平台上创建一个新的机器人。我们可以直接使用Telegram消息应用程序，搜索栏中搜索BotFather。一旦打开，我们将输入命令<code>/newbot</code>来创建机器人并按照BotFather的指示操作。它会要求我们为机器人分配一个用户名，根据Telegram的政策，用户名需要以_bot结尾：</p>`,r:{minutes:6.81,words:2044},t:"使用Spring Boot创建Telegram机器人",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Executing%20SQL%20Script%20File%20in%20Java.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Executing SQL Script File in Java.html-CxrnWvTV.js"),__vite__mapDeps([412,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","SQL"],g:["MyBatis","Spring JDBC"],e:`

<h2>组合模式概览</h2>
<p>现在，让我们深入组合模式的理论。</p>
<h3>2.1. 定义</h3>
<p>组合模式是一种结构模式，允许我们统一地对待一组对象。当我们有像树这样的对象层次结构，并希望像对待单个对象一样对整个结构执行操作时，这种模式就非常有用。</p>
<p>这种模式的关键思想是我们有不同类型的对象：叶子或单独的对象和组合对象。这些不同类型的对象需要实现一个公共的超类型，例如接口或抽象类。<strong>公共接口或组件定义了可以在我们对象层次结构中不同类型的对象上执行的操作</strong>。</p>`,r:{minutes:5.48,words:1643},t:"Kotlin中的组合模式",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Update%20an%20Existing%20Amazon%20S3%20Object%20Using%20Java.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Update an Existing Amazon S3 Object Using Java.html-BAwP-Zxp.js"),__vite__mapDeps([433,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["AWS","Java"],g:["Amazon S3","Java SDK"],e:'\n<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service（Amazon S3）是一种广泛使用的存储服务，提供可扩展、安全和持久的对象存储。有时我们需要更新现有的Amazon S3对象。在S3中，对象是不可变的，这意味着我们不能直接修改对象的内容。然而，我们可以通过使用新内容覆盖对象，有效地“更新”它。</p>\n<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用AWS Java SDK，用更新后的内容替换同一AWS S3路径上的现有文件内容。</p>\n<h2>2. 先决条件</h2>\n<p>首先，我们需要确保AWS SDK Maven依赖包被纳入项目中：</p>\n<div class="language-text" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>`&lt;dependency&gt;`\n    `&lt;groupId&gt;`software.amazon.awssdk`&lt;/groupId&gt;`\n    `&lt;artifactId&gt;`s3`&lt;/artifactId&gt;`\n    `&lt;version&gt;`2.24.9`&lt;/version&gt;`\n`&lt;/dependency&gt;`\n</code></pre></div>',r:{minutes:3.72,words:1115},t:"使用Java更新现有的Amazon S3对象",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-What%20Does%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Mean%20in%20Java%20.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-01-What Does       Mean in Java .html-Ds4D8nTd.js"),__vite__mapDeps([434,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java"],g:["Java","编程技巧"],e:`

<h1>Java中的无状态对象</h1>
<p>在本教程中，我们将讨论如何在Java中实现无状态对象。<strong>无状态对象是没有实例字段的类实例</strong>。</p>
<p>在Java中，我们所有的代码都必须放在一个类中。在编写算法时，我们可能只需要在类中提供静态方法来实现这一点。</p>
<p>然而，有时我们可能希望将我们的算法绑定到一个无状态对象上。</p>
<p>当我们考虑Java中的对象时，我们通常想到的是包含字段状态的对象，以及操作该状态以提供行为的方法。</p>

<p>在本教程中，我们将探讨Kafka主题和分区以及它们是如何相互关联的。</p>
<h2>2. Kafka主题是什么</h2>
<p><strong>主题是一个存储事件序列的机制。</strong> 从根本上说，主题是持久的日志文件，它们按照事件发生的时间顺序保持事件的顺序。因此，每个新事件总是被添加到日志的末尾。此外，<strong>事件是不可变的</strong>。因此，一旦事件被添加到主题中，我们就不能更改它们。</p>
<p>Kafka主题的一个示例用例是记录一个房间的温度测量序列。一旦记录了温度值，比如下午5:02的25摄氏度，它就不能被改变，因为它已经发生了。此外，下午5:06的温度值不能早于在下午5:02记录的温度值。因此，通过将每个温度测量视为一个事件，Kafka主题将是存储该数据的合适选择。</p>`,r:{minutes:6.44,words:1931},t:"Kafka主题和分区的理解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-02/2024-07-02-Understanding%20the%20java.net.SocketException%20Broken%20Pipe%20Error.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-02-Understanding the java.net.SocketException Broken Pipe Error.html-BwqI9ki1.js"),__vite__mapDeps([475,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","Networking"],g:["SocketException","Broken Pipe"],e:`

<p>在这一部分，让我们看看Kotlin代码中反引号的各种用法。</p>
<h3>2.1. 转义关键字</h3>
<p>反引号最常见的用途之一是转义保留关键字。通常，我们不能在Kotlin中将关键字用作变量或函数名。然而，在某些情况下，我们可能需要将关键字用作标识符。在这些情况下，我们可以使用反引号来转义关键字。让我们看一个例子：</p>`,r:{minutes:4.75,words:1425},t:"Kotlin中反引号的使用",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Using%20the%20%20Value%20Annotation%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Using the  Value Annotation in Kotlin.html-CiaLWPd5.js"),__vite__mapDeps([559,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Spring","Kotlin"],g:["Value注解","Annotation"],e:`
<p>在Spring中，@Value注解是一种强大的方式，可以从配置文件中将属性注入到类中。@Value在Kotlin中的工作方式与Java类似，但由于Kotlin语言特性如空安全和默认构造函数，它有一些细微的差别。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何正确使用@Value。</p>
<h2>2. @Value的基本使用</h2>
<p>@Value注解允许我们将应用程序属性文件中的值直接注入到我们的Spring Bean中。<strong>我们必须在属性占位符字符串中转义美元符号，因为Kotlin字符串也使用它进行字符串插值。</strong></p>
<p>让我们编写MyBean来演示这一点：</p>`,r:{minutes:2.66,words:797},t:"在Kotlin中使用@Value注解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Variable%20Shadowing%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Variable Shadowing in Kotlin.html-BDPPqzYw.js"),__vite__mapDeps([560,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Kotlin"],g:["Variable Shadowing","Programming"],e:`
<p>在Kotlin中，每个在作用域内声明的变量都会遮蔽作用域外同名的变量。这适用于所有作用域级别，例如函数内、类内或代码块中。</p>
<p>有时，变量遮蔽是有用的——例如，用于将我们的代码与系统的其他部分隔离。然而，对于不熟悉它的人来说，这可能会造成混淆。尽管Kotlin允许这样做，但它强烈建议尽可能避免使用遮蔽。如果我们使用像IntelliJ IDEA这样的IDE，我们将很容易发现为我们突出显示的警告。</p>
<p>在本教程中，<strong>我们将讨论一些在Kotlin中可能发生遮蔽的情况。</strong></p>

<p>创建事务使我们能够避免代码中的部分失败，提高数据一致性。</p>

<h1>Java中将类作为参数传递</h1>

<p><strong>在本教程中，我们将深入探讨在Java中实现这一点的不同方法。</strong></p>
<h2>2. 问题定义</h2>
<p>在Java中，类作为对象的蓝图，定义了它们的属性和行为。此外，将类作为参数传递意味着提供对类本身的引用，而不是类的实例。</p>
