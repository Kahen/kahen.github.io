<p>一个常见的误解是，获取字符串的镜像反射仅仅涉及反转其顺序。以字符串“ALL”为例。直观上，人们可能会期望它的镜像反射是“LLA”。然而，通过实际使用镜子仔细检查，我们发现“LLA”并不符合“ALL”的镜像版本。</p>
<p>关键的误解在于，字符串中的<strong>每个单独字符在其镜像反射中都会发生反转</strong>。因此，“ALL”的镜像反射实际上看起来像“⅃⅃A”。</p>
<p>字符可以根据其反转行为被归类为对称或不对称。<strong>对称字符是指在反转时保持不变的字符</strong>，例如‘A’、‘O’、‘o’、‘V’、‘v’、‘M’、‘8’、‘+’、‘-’等。相反，不对称字符与其反转形式不同，例如‘L’、‘S’、‘p’、‘h’、‘/’、‘3’等。</p>`,r:{minutes:3.26,words:977},t:"检查字符串是否等于其镜像反射",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-22/2024-06-22-Collect%20Stream%20of%20entrySet%20%20%20to%20a%20LinkedHashMap.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-22-Collect Stream of entrySet   to a LinkedHashMap.html-4h7YJLvI.js"),__vite__mapDeps([39,1])),meta:{d:17190144e5,l:"2024年6月22日",c:["Java","Tutorial"],g:["LinkedHashMap","Stream","Java 8"],e:`

<h1>Java中将公历转换为回历日期</h1>
<h2>1. 概述</h2>

<p>然而，在某些情况下，由于选定的API的限制，我们必须将字符串写入_OutputStream_。在某些情况下，API可能只提供_OutputStream_而不是_Writer_。在本教程中，我们将探讨在这种情况下将字符串写入_OutputStream_的不同方法。</p>`,r:{minutes:3.39,words:1017},t:"如何在Java中将字符串写入OutputStream",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-25/2024-06-25-Java%20System.currentTimeMillis%20%20%20Vs.%20System.nanoTime%20%20.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-25-Java System.currentTimeMillis   Vs.

<h2>2. 问题介绍</h2>
<p>枚举类型提供了一种强大的方式，在不同的类型中表示一组固定的值。动态确认一个对象是否是枚举类型对于编写健壮和类型安全的代码至关重要。</p>
<p>例如，我们有一个简单的枚举：</p>

<h3>1. Java 11之前</h3>
<p>在Java 11之前，StringBuilder并没有内置的比较方法。因此，我们需要编写自己的比较方法。首先检查两个被比较对象的长度是否相同。如果不同，我们可以立即判断它们不匹配。</p>

<h1>如何解决在运行Maven时出现的“打开Zip文件错误”</h1>

<h2>2. 一般建议</h2>
<p>在进行任何优化尝试之前，让我们回顾一下，<strong>使用正确的Maven阶段可以节省我们大量的时间</strong>。为什么我们要运行完整的_install_并污染我们的本地仓库，而我们只需要编译代码呢？</p>
<p>另一方面，在多模块项目中，我们只能重新构建更改过的模块以及依赖它们的模块。例如，如果我们只在_module1_和_module2_中进行更改，我们可以运行：</p>
<div class="language-bash" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ mvn clean <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-pl</span> module1,module2 <span class="token parameter variable">-am</span>

<p>在本教程中，我们将更仔细地研究Java中的两个重要构造：内部类和子类。Java中编写类的两种不同方式，它们的使用方式也有所不同。</p>
<p>面向对象编程的一个核心原则是继承。它引入了一个类继承另一个类，即父类的属性和行为的概念。<strong>继承和子类的使用促进了代码的可重用性和类的层次结构组织。</strong></p>
<p>子类定义了与父类的“是一个”关系，即子类的对象也是其父类的对象。这支持了多态性的概念，并通过允许我们通过共同的父类与不同子类的实例一起工作，促进了更通用的编码。</p>
<p>定义和使用子类还允许我们创建高度专业化的类，这些类可以扩展和覆盖其父类的具体功能。<strong>这支持了SOLID原则中的开放封闭原则。</strong></p>`,r:{minutes:6.16,words:1848},t:"Java中的内部类与子类",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Lock%20Header%20Rows%20With%20Apache%20POI.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Lock Header Rows With Apache POI.html-7jCsGDcF.js"),__vite__mapDeps([426,1])),meta:{d:1690848e6,l:"2023年8月1日",c:["Java","Apache POI"],g:["Excel","锁定","表头"],e:'<hr>\n<h1>使用Apache POI锁定Excel表头行</h1>\n<p>Apache POI是一个在Java社区中广受欢迎的开源库，用于处理Microsoft Office文档。它允许开发人员轻松地以编程方式操作Word文档和Excel电子表格文件。</p>\n<p>锁定表头行是我们处理大型Excel电子表格时常见的操作。这为数据导航和分析提供了更加友好的用户体验。</p>\n<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用Apache POI来锁定Excel电子表格中的表头行。</p>\n<h3>2. 依赖性</h3>\n<p>首先，让我们向_pom.xml_文件中添加以下Maven依赖项：</p>\n<div class="language-text" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>``&lt;dependency&gt;``\n    ``&lt;groupId&gt;``org.apache.poi``&lt;/groupId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;artifactId&gt;``poi``&lt;/artifactId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;version&gt;``5.2.5``&lt;/version&gt;``\n``&lt;/dependency&gt;``\n``&lt;dependency&gt;``\n    ``&lt;groupId&gt;``org.apache.poi``&lt;/groupId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;artifactId&gt;``poi-ooxml``&lt;/artifactId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;version&gt;``5.2.5``&lt;/version&gt;``\n``&lt;/dependency&gt;``\n</code></pre></div>',r:{minutes:2.9,words:869},t:"使用Apache POI锁定Excel表头行",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Programmatic%20Generation%20of%20JSON%20Schemas%20in%20Java.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Programmatic Generation of JSON Schemas in Java.html-ELC8Am15.js"),__vite__mapDeps([427,1])),meta:{d:1719792e6,l:"2024年7月1日",c:["Java","JSON Schema"],g:["Java","JSON Schema","自动生成"],e:`

<p>组合模式是一种结构模式，允许我们统一地对待一组对象。当我们有像树这样的对象层次结构，并希望像对待单个对象一样对整个结构执行操作时，这种模式就非常有用。</p>

自Java 14起，_switch_表达式中的_yield_关键字为我们提供了一种更好的方法。
<em>yield_关键字允许我们通过返回一个值来退出_switch_表达式，该值成为_switch_表达式的值。
这意味着我们可以将_switch_表达式的值分配给一个变量。

<h2>2. 理解迪米特法则</h2>
<p>迪米特法则是面向对象编程中的几种设计指南之一。<strong>它建议对象应避免访问其他对象的内部数据和方法</strong>。相反，对象应该只与其直接依赖项交互。</p>
<p>该概念最初由Karl J. Lieberherr等人在一篇论文中提出。它指出：</p>`,r:{minutes:5.26,words:1578},t:"迪米特法则在Java中的应用",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-02/2024-07-02-Matching%20Varargs%20Using%20MockK%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-02-Matching Varargs Using MockK in Kotlin.html-CE7OXlz0.js"),__vite__mapDeps([463,1])),meta:{d:16672608e5,l:"2022年11月1日",c:["Kotlin","MockK"],g:["MockK","varargs"],e:`
<p>MockK 是一个功能强大的 Kotlin 测试模拟库。当涉及到使用可变参数（varargs）的函数时，MockK 提供了优雅的解决方案。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用 MockK 来模拟带有 vararg 参数的函数。</p>
<h2>2. MockK 对 Varargs 的支持</h2>

<p>Kafka主题的一个示例用例是记录一个房间的温度测量序列。一旦记录了温度值，比如下午5:02的25摄氏度，它就不能被改变，因为它已经发生了。此外，下午5:06的温度值不能早于在下午5:02记录的温度值。因此，通过将每个温度测量视为一个事件，Kafka主题将是存储该数据的合适选择。</p>`,r:{minutes:6.44,words:1931},t:"Kafka主题和分区的理解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-02/2024-07-02-Understanding%20the%20java.net.SocketException%20Broken%20Pipe%20Error.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-07-02-Understanding the java.net.SocketException Broken Pipe Error.html-Co5AyFnb.js"),__vite__mapDeps([475,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","Networking"],g:["SocketException","Broken Pipe"],e:`

<h1>Kotlin中反引号的使用</h1>
<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p>Kotlin允许我们在定义变量和函数时使用反引号(\`)包围标识符。本教程将探讨使用反引号的不同方式以及它们的好处。</p>
<h2>2. 反引号的使用</h2>
<p>默认情况下，Kotlin遵循严格的函数和变量命名约定。然而，<strong>当我们需要以与这些规则冲突的方式命名函数或变量时，反引号就派上用场了</strong>。</p>
<p>在这一部分，让我们看看Kotlin代码中反引号的各种用法。</p>
<h3>2.1. 转义关键字</h3>
<p>反引号最常见的用途之一是转义保留关键字。通常，我们不能在Kotlin中将关键字用作变量或函数名。然而，在某些情况下，我们可能需要将关键字用作标识符。在这些情况下，我们可以使用反引号来转义关键字。让我们看一个例子：</p>`,r:{minutes:4.75,words:1425},t:"Kotlin中反引号的使用",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Using%20the%20%20Value%20Annotation%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Using the  Value Annotation in Kotlin.html-CEJqTJdb.js"),__vite__mapDeps([615,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Spring","Kotlin"],g:["Value注解","Annotation"],e:`
<p>在Spring中，@Value注解是一种强大的方式，可以从配置文件中将属性注入到类中。@Value在Kotlin中的工作方式与Java类似，但由于Kotlin语言特性如空安全和默认构造函数，它有一些细微的差别。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何正确使用@Value。</p>
<h2>2. @Value的基本使用</h2>
<p>@Value注解允许我们将应用程序属性文件中的值直接注入到我们的Spring Bean中。<strong>我们必须在属性占位符字符串中转义美元符号，因为Kotlin字符串也使用它进行字符串插值。</strong></p>
<p>让我们编写MyBean来演示这一点：</p>`,r:{minutes:2.66,words:797},t:"在Kotlin中使用@Value注解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Variable%20Shadowing%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>n(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Variable Shadowing in Kotlin.html-BcphXz6R.js"),__vite__mapDeps([616,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Kotlin"],g:["Variable Shadowing","Programming"],e:`
<p>在Kotlin中，每个在作用域内声明的变量都会遮蔽作用域外同名的变量。这适用于所有作用域级别，例如函数内、类内或代码块中。</p>
<p>有时，变量遮蔽是有用的——例如，用于将我们的代码与系统的其他部分隔离。然而，对于不熟悉它的人来说，这可能会造成混淆。尽管Kotlin允许这样做，但它强烈建议尽可能避免使用遮蔽。如果我们使用像IntelliJ IDEA这样的IDE，我们将很容易发现为我们突出显示的警告。</p>
<p>在本教程中，<strong>我们将讨论一些在Kotlin中可能发生遮蔽的情况。</strong></p>

<p>创建事务使我们能够避免代码中的部分失败，提高数据一致性。</p>
