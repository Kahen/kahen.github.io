<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p><strong>GraphQL 是一种强大的 API 查询语言，为我们与数据的交互提供了灵活而高效的方式。</strong> 当处理 mutation（变更）时，我们通常会在服务器上执行数据的更新或添加。然而，在某些场景中，我们可能需要进行变更而不返回任何数据。</p>
<p>在 GraphQL 中，默认行为是强制字段在模式中为非空性，这意味着除非明确标记为可空，否则字段必须始终返回一个值，不能为 null。虽然这种严格性有助于 API 的清晰度和可预测性，但有时返回 null 可能是必要的。然而，通常认为避免返回 null 值是一个最佳实践。</p>

<h2>2. 字符串旋转简介</h2>
<p>在深入一些解决方案之前，让我们讨论一下字符串旋转以及我们应该为算法测试什么。</p>
<h3>2.1. 字符串和字符串旋转</h3>

<p>当我们在Java中工作时，字符串操作和比较是日常任务。</p>
<p>在这个快速教程中，我们将深入探讨一个有趣的问题：检查字符串是否等于其镜像反射。</p>
<h2>2. 问题介绍</h2>
<p>一个常见的误解是，获取字符串的镜像反射仅仅涉及反转其顺序。以字符串“ALL”为例。直观上，人们可能会期望它的镜像反射是“LLA”。然而，通过实际使用镜子仔细检查，我们发现“LLA”并不符合“ALL”的镜像版本。</p>
<p>关键的误解在于，字符串中的<strong>每个单独字符在其镜像反射中都会发生反转</strong>。因此，“ALL”的镜像反射实际上看起来像“⅃⅃A”。</p>
<p>字符可以根据其反转行为被归类为对称或不对称。<strong>对称字符是指在反转时保持不变的字符</strong>，例如‘A’、‘O’、‘o’、‘V’、‘v’、‘M’、‘8’、‘+’、‘-’等。相反，不对称字符与其反转形式不同，例如‘L’、‘S’、‘p’、‘h’、‘/’、‘3’等。</p>`,r:{minutes:3.26,words:977},t:"检查字符串是否等于其镜像反射",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-22/2024-06-22-Collect%20Stream%20of%20entrySet%20%20%20to%20a%20LinkedHashMap.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-06-22-Collect Stream of entrySet   to a LinkedHashMap.html-CSnVhXt7.js"),__vite__mapDeps([39,1])),meta:{d:17190144e5,l:"2024年6月22日",c:["Java","Tutorial"],g:["LinkedHashMap","Stream","Java 8"],e:`

<li>另一方面，5不是平衡索引，因为A[0] + A[1] + A[2] + A[3] + A[4] = 1 + (-3) + 0 + 4 + (-5) = -3，而A[6] + A[7] + A[8] + A[9] = 0 + 1 + (-2) + (-1) = -2</li>

<h1>Java中将公历转换为回历日期</h1>
<h2>1. 概述</h2>
<p>公历和回历代表了两种不同的时间测量系统。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将探讨将公历日期转换为回历日期的各种方法。</p>
<h2>2. 公历与回历日历的区别</h2>
<p>让我们了解公历和回历日历之间的区别。公历遵循太阳年，由12个长度固定的月份组成。回历遵循月亮年，有12个月，每个月交替为29天和30天。</p>
<p>在回历中，每个月的长度取决于月亮绕地球完整旋转的周期。<strong>公历年包含365天或366天，而回历年有354天或355天。这意味着回历年比公历年大约短11天。</strong></p>`,r:{minutes:2.71,words:812},t:"Java中将公历转换为回历日期",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-06-23/2024-06-23-Convert%20Long%20to%20Date%20in%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-06-23-Convert Long to Date in Java.html-DQ4gQWb9.js"),__vite__mapDeps([83,1])),meta:{d:17191008e5,l:"2024年6月23日",c:["Java","日期时间"],g:["Java","日期转换","Instant","LocalDate","Joda-Time"],e:`

<h1>如何解决在运行Maven时出现的“打开Zip文件错误”</h1>

<h2>2. 一般建议</h2>
<p>在进行任何优化尝试之前，让我们回顾一下，<strong>使用正确的Maven阶段可以节省我们大量的时间</strong>。为什么我们要运行完整的_install_并污染我们的本地仓库，而我们只需要编译代码呢？</p>
<p>另一方面，在多模块项目中，我们只能重新构建更改过的模块以及依赖它们的模块。例如，如果我们只在_module1_和_module2_中进行更改，我们可以运行：</p>
<div class="language-bash" data-ext="sh" data-title="sh"><pre class="language-bash"><code>$ mvn clean <span class="token function">install</span> <span class="token parameter variable">-pl</span> module1,module2 <span class="token parameter variable">-am</span>

<p>在本教程中，我们将更仔细地研究Java中的两个重要构造：内部类和子类。Java中编写类的两种不同方式，它们的使用方式也有所不同。</p>
<p>面向对象编程的一个核心原则是继承。它引入了一个类继承另一个类，即父类的属性和行为的概念。<strong>继承和子类的使用促进了代码的可重用性和类的层次结构组织。</strong></p>
<p>子类定义了与父类的“是一个”关系，即子类的对象也是其父类的对象。这支持了多态性的概念，并通过允许我们通过共同的父类与不同子类的实例一起工作，促进了更通用的编码。</p>
<p>定义和使用子类还允许我们创建高度专业化的类，这些类可以扩展和覆盖其父类的具体功能。<strong>这支持了SOLID原则中的开放封闭原则。</strong></p>`,r:{minutes:6.16,words:1848},t:"Java中的内部类与子类",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Lock%20Header%20Rows%20With%20Apache%20POI.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Lock Header Rows With Apache POI.html-r9Ri-9E5.js"),__vite__mapDeps([426,1])),meta:{d:1690848e6,l:"2023年8月1日",c:["Java","Apache POI"],g:["Excel","锁定","表头"],e:'<hr>\n<h1>使用Apache POI锁定Excel表头行</h1>\n<p>Apache POI是一个在Java社区中广受欢迎的开源库，用于处理Microsoft Office文档。它允许开发人员轻松地以编程方式操作Word文档和Excel电子表格文件。</p>\n<p>锁定表头行是我们处理大型Excel电子表格时常见的操作。这为数据导航和分析提供了更加友好的用户体验。</p>\n<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用Apache POI来锁定Excel电子表格中的表头行。</p>\n<h3>2. 依赖性</h3>\n<p>首先，让我们向_pom.xml_文件中添加以下Maven依赖项：</p>\n<div class="language-text" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>``&lt;dependency&gt;``\n    ``&lt;groupId&gt;``org.apache.poi``&lt;/groupId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;artifactId&gt;``poi``&lt;/artifactId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;version&gt;``5.2.5``&lt;/version&gt;``\n``&lt;/dependency&gt;``\n``&lt;dependency&gt;``\n    ``&lt;groupId&gt;``org.apache.poi``&lt;/groupId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;artifactId&gt;``poi-ooxml``&lt;/artifactId&gt;``\n    ``&lt;version&gt;``5.2.5``&lt;/version&gt;``\n``&lt;/dependency&gt;``\n</code></pre></div>',r:{minutes:2.9,words:869},t:"使用Apache POI锁定Excel表头行",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Programmatic%20Generation%20of%20JSON%20Schemas%20in%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Programmatic Generation of JSON Schemas in Java.html-BJFKDj0y.js"),__vite__mapDeps([427,1])),meta:{d:1719792e6,l:"2024年7月1日",c:["Java","JSON Schema"],g:["Java","JSON Schema","自动生成"],e:`

<p>组合模式是一种结构模式，允许我们统一地对待一组对象。当我们有像树这样的对象层次结构，并希望像对待单个对象一样对整个结构执行操作时，这种模式就非常有用。</p>
<p>这种模式的关键思想是我们有不同类型的对象：叶子或单独的对象和组合对象。这些不同类型的对象需要实现一个公共的超类型，例如接口或抽象类。<strong>公共接口或组件定义了可以在我们对象层次结构中不同类型的对象上执行的操作</strong>。</p>`,r:{minutes:5.48,words:1643},t:"Kotlin中的组合模式",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-Update%20an%20Existing%20Amazon%20S3%20Object%20Using%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-01-Update an Existing Amazon S3 Object Using Java.html-B2A75J_n.js"),__vite__mapDeps([433,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["AWS","Java"],g:["Amazon S3","Java SDK"],e:'\n<p>Amazon Simple Storage Service（Amazon S3）是一种广泛使用的存储服务，提供可扩展、安全和持久的对象存储。有时我们需要更新现有的Amazon S3对象。在S3中，对象是不可变的，这意味着我们不能直接修改对象的内容。然而，我们可以通过使用新内容覆盖对象，有效地“更新”它。</p>\n<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用AWS Java SDK，用更新后的内容替换同一AWS S3路径上的现有文件内容。</p>\n<h2>2. 先决条件</h2>\n<p>首先，我们需要确保AWS SDK Maven依赖包被纳入项目中：</p>\n<div class="language-text" data-ext="text" data-title="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>`&lt;dependency&gt;`\n    `&lt;groupId&gt;`software.amazon.awssdk`&lt;/groupId&gt;`\n    `&lt;artifactId&gt;`s3`&lt;/artifactId&gt;`\n    `&lt;version&gt;`2.24.9`&lt;/version&gt;`\n`&lt;/dependency&gt;`\n</code></pre></div>',r:{minutes:3.72,words:1115},t:"使用Java更新现有的Amazon S3对象",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-01/2024-07-01-What%20Does%20%20%20%20%20%20%20Mean%20in%20Java%20.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-01-What Does       Mean in Java .html-06Kv9_nh.js"),__vite__mapDeps([434,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java"],g:["Java","编程技巧"],e:`

自Java 14起，_switch_表达式中的_yield_关键字为我们提供了一种更好的方法。
<em>yield_关键字允许我们通过返回一个值来退出_switch_表达式，该值成为_switch_表达式的值。
这意味着我们可以将_switch_表达式的值分配给一个变量。

<h2>2. 理解迪米特法则</h2>
<p>迪米特法则是面向对象编程中的几种设计指南之一。<strong>它建议对象应避免访问其他对象的内部数据和方法</strong>。相反，对象应该只与其直接依赖项交互。</p>
<p>该概念最初由Karl J. Lieberherr等人在一篇论文中提出。它指出：</p>`,r:{minutes:5.26,words:1578},t:"迪米特法则在Java中的应用",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-02/2024-07-02-Matching%20Varargs%20Using%20MockK%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-02-Matching Varargs Using MockK in Kotlin.html-dVTt3GRd.js"),__vite__mapDeps([463,1])),meta:{d:16672608e5,l:"2022年11月1日",c:["Kotlin","MockK"],g:["MockK","varargs"],e:`
<p>MockK 是一个功能强大的 Kotlin 测试模拟库。当涉及到使用可变参数（varargs）的函数时，MockK 提供了优雅的解决方案。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何使用 MockK 来模拟带有 vararg 参数的函数。</p>
<h2>2. MockK 对 Varargs 的支持</h2>

<p>Kafka主题的一个示例用例是记录一个房间的温度测量序列。一旦记录了温度值，比如下午5:02的25摄氏度，它就不能被改变，因为它已经发生了。此外，下午5:06的温度值不能早于在下午5:02记录的温度值。因此，通过将每个温度测量视为一个事件，Kafka主题将是存储该数据的合适选择。</p>`,r:{minutes:6.44,words:1931},t:"Kafka主题和分区的理解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-02/2024-07-02-Understanding%20the%20java.net.SocketException%20Broken%20Pipe%20Error.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-02-Understanding the java.net.SocketException Broken Pipe Error.html-DmeDXaG3.js"),__vite__mapDeps([475,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","Networking"],g:["SocketException","Broken Pipe"],e:`

<p>一个句子是一组单词。我们将用Java的_String_来表示它。此外，我们假设每个非空白字符都是单词的一部分。最后，我们将强调技术边缘情况：null、空或空白的_String_没有最长的单词。</p>
<h2>2. 查找一个最长的单词</h2>
<p>首先，让我们找到句子中的最长单词。例如，在句子：“<em>This is a phrase with words</em>”，最长的单词是_phrase_。如果有多个单词具有相同的长度，任何一个都是可接受的答案。如果句子中没有单词，则没有结果。因此，我们的方法返回一个_Optional_：</p>`,r:{minutes:2.88,words:863},t:"在Java中查找给定字符串中的最长单词 | Baeldung",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-06/2024-07-06-Generate%20UUIDs%20as%20Primary%20Keys%20With%20Hibernate.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-06-Generate UUIDs as Primary Keys With Hibernate.html-BuvmPg-A.js"),__vite__mapDeps([618,1])),meta:{d:1720224e6,l:"2024年7月6日",c:["Java","Hibernate"],g:["UUID","JPA"],e:`

<p>我们根据要求评估软件并报告缺陷，使其可靠且健壮。如果软件不符合指定的要求，无论是功能还是非功能，它就毫无用处。此外，它必须始终有效地处理所有异常和边缘情况。软件测试对于提供高效、准确和可用的产品至关重要且不可避免。</p>`,r:{minutes:6.5,words:1951},t:"功能测试与非功能测试 | Baeldung",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-07/2024-07-07-Generate%20the%20Same%20UUID%20From%20a%20String%20in%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-07-Generate the Same UUID From a String in Java.html-oovR9deX.js"),__vite__mapDeps([656,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java"],g:["UUID","Java"],e:`

<p>转到JPA，当一个实体对相关实体的集合有引用时，可以建立两个实体之间的单向一对多关系。然而，我们不能从相关实体回溯到第一个实体。通常，包含引用的实体称为父实体，被引用的实体称为子实体。</p>`,r:{minutes:4.81,words:1443},t:"JPA中单向一对多关系及级联删除",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-07/2024-07-07-Use%20Mapper%20in%20Another%20Mapper%20with%20Mapstruct%20and%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-07-Use Mapper in Another Mapper with Mapstruct and Java.html-BBERr0tT.js"),__vite__mapDeps([676,1])),meta:{d:17203104e5,l:"2024年7月7日",c:["Java","MapStruct"],g:["编程","映射"],e:`

<p>在本教程中，我们将探讨在Kotlin中将数组和_Set_之间进行转换的不同方式。</p>
<p>数组是一种用于有序元素集合的数据结构，而Set通过不允许重复元素来保证其唯一性。</p>
<p>在这一部分，让我们看看将数组转换为Set的多种方式。</p>
<h3>2.1. 使用 <em>toSet()</em></h3>
<p>我们可以使用数组上的_toSet()_ 方法将其转换为Set。让我们看一个例子：</p>`,r:{minutes:4,words:1201},t:"Kotlin中数组与Set的转换 | Baeldung关于Kotlin",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-09/2024-07-09-Convert%20Hex%20to%20RGB%20Using%20Java.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-09-Convert Hex to RGB Using Java.html-DSsZJOac.js"),__vite__mapDeps([724,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","编程"],g:["十六进制","RGB"],e:`

<h2>2. RabbitMQ消息模型</h2>
<p>在我们开始之前，让我们快速回顾一下RabbitMQ消息的工作方式。</p>
<p>我们首先需要理解AMQP的构建块，也称为AMQP实体。交换器、队列和绑定统称为AMQP实体。</p>
<p>在RabbitMQ中，消息生产者永远不会直接向队列发送消息。相反，它使用一个_交换器_作为路由中介。消息生产者将消息发布到_交换器_。然后，交换器根据称为_绑定_的路由规则将这些消息路由到不同的_队列_。代理随后将消息传递给订阅队列的消费者，或者消费者按需从队列中拉取/获取消息。消息传递给消费者基于FIFO模型。</p>`,r:{minutes:4.89,words:1467},t:"在RabbitMQ中创建动态队列",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/2024-07-09/2024-07-09-Difference%20Between%20Class.forName%20%20%20and%20Class.forName%20%20.newInstance%20%20.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-07-09-Difference Between Class.forName   and Class.forName  .newInstance  .html-DMkInIVK.js"),__vite__mapDeps([726,1])),meta:{d:16487712e5,l:"2022年4月1日",c:["Java","编程"],g:["Class.forName()","newInstance()"],e:`

<li>标准属性：这些属性是预定义的，并且被浏览器所识别。例如_id_, <em>class</em>, <em>src</em>, <em>href</em>, <em>alt</em>, _title_等。标准属性具有预定义的含义，并且在不同的HTML元素中广泛使用。</li>
<li>自定义属性：自定义属性不是HTML规范预定义的，而是由开发人员为特定需求创建的。这些属性通常以“<em>data-</em>”开头，后面跟着一个描述性名称。例如_data-id_, <em>data-toggle</em>, _data-target_等。自定义属性对于存储与元素相关的额外信息或元数据很有用，它们通常在Web开发中用于在HTML和JavaScript之间传递数据。</li>

<h1>Kotlin中反引号的使用</h1>
<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p>Kotlin允许我们在定义变量和函数时使用反引号(\`)包围标识符。本教程将探讨使用反引号的不同方式以及它们的好处。</p>
<h2>2. 反引号的使用</h2>
<p>默认情况下，Kotlin遵循严格的函数和变量命名约定。然而，<strong>当我们需要以与这些规则冲突的方式命名函数或变量时，反引号就派上用场了</strong>。</p>
<p>在这一部分，让我们看看Kotlin代码中反引号的各种用法。</p>
<h3>2.1. 转义关键字</h3>
<p>反引号最常见的用途之一是转义保留关键字。通常，我们不能在Kotlin中将关键字用作变量或函数名。然而，在某些情况下，我们可能需要将关键字用作标识符。在这些情况下，我们可以使用反引号来转义关键字。让我们看一个例子：</p>`,r:{minutes:4.75,words:1425},t:"Kotlin中反引号的使用",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Using%20the%20%20Value%20Annotation%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Using the  Value Annotation in Kotlin.html-_XiWKips.js"),__vite__mapDeps([892,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Spring","Kotlin"],g:["Value注解","Annotation"],e:`
<p>在Spring中，@Value注解是一种强大的方式，可以从配置文件中将属性注入到类中。@Value在Kotlin中的工作方式与Java类似，但由于Kotlin语言特性如空安全和默认构造函数，它有一些细微的差别。</p>
<p>在本教程中，我们将学习如何正确使用@Value。</p>
<h2>2. @Value的基本使用</h2>
<p>@Value注解允许我们将应用程序属性文件中的值直接注入到我们的Spring Bean中。<strong>我们必须在属性占位符字符串中转义美元符号，因为Kotlin字符串也使用它进行字符串插值。</strong></p>
<p>让我们编写MyBean来演示这一点：</p>`,r:{minutes:2.66,words:797},t:"在Kotlin中使用@Value注解",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/2024-06-20-Variable%20Shadowing%20in%20Kotlin.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./2024-06-20-Variable Shadowing in Kotlin.html-jmeI5-Ej.js"),__vite__mapDeps([893,1])),meta:{d:17188416e5,l:"2024年6月20日",c:["Kotlin"],g:["Variable Shadowing","Programming"],e:`
<p>在Kotlin中，每个在作用域内声明的变量都会遮蔽作用域外同名的变量。这适用于所有作用域级别，例如函数内、类内或代码块中。</p>
<p>有时，变量遮蔽是有用的——例如，用于将我们的代码与系统的其他部分隔离。然而，对于不熟悉它的人来说，这可能会造成混淆。尽管Kotlin允许这样做，但它强烈建议尽可能避免使用遮蔽。如果我们使用像IntelliJ IDEA这样的IDE，我们将很容易发现为我们突出显示的警告。</p>
<p>在本教程中，<strong>我们将讨论一些在Kotlin中可能发生遮蔽的情况。</strong></p>

<h2>2. 什么是峰值元素？</h2>
<p><strong>数组中的峰值元素定义为严格大于其相邻元素的元素。</strong> 如果边元素大于它们唯一的相邻元素，则认为它们处于峰值位置。</p>

<h2>1. 引言</h2>
<p>在软件开发的旅程中，我们经常遇到创建具有众多属性的对象的场景，这可能令人生畏。构造函数的混乱使得我们的代码可读性降低。这正是建造者模式大放异彩的地方。<strong>建造者模式是一种创建型设计模式，它将复杂对象的构建与其表示分离，提供了一种更干净、更灵活的对象创建方法。</strong></p>
<h2>2. 建造者模式的优势</h2>
<p>在我们深入编码之前，让我们快速回顾一下使用建造者模式的优势：</p>
<ul>
<li>灵活性 - 通过将构建过程与实际对象表示解耦，建造者模式允许我们以不同的配置创建对象，而不会在我们的代码库中充斥着多个构造函数或设置器</li>
<li>可读性 - 建造者模式提供了流畅的接口，使我们的代码更易于阅读；这使我们和其他开发人员能够一目了然地理解复杂对象的构建过程</li>
<li>不可变性 - 建造者可以通过在构建完成后创建不可变对象来强制执行不可变性；这确保了线程安全性并防止了意外的修改</li>

<h3>2.1. 压缩器和归档器之间的区别</h3>
<p><strong>归档器（例如 TAR）将目录结构捆绑到一个单一文件中，而压缩器接收一个字节流并使其变小，节省空间。</strong> 有些格式（如 ZIP）可以充当归档器和压缩器，但库中将其视为归档器。</p>`,r:{minutes:7.53,words:2258},t:"Apache Commons Compress 项目简介",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/Introduction%20to%20Brave.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./Introduction to Brave.html-BNPX_f2d.js"),__vite__mapDeps([995,1])),meta:{d:17187552e5,l:"2024年6月19日",c:["Java","Spring"],g:["Brave","Zipkin","分布式追踪"],e:`

<h2>2. 分布式追踪的理解</h2>
<p>分布式追踪是一种用于监控和排查由相互连接的服务组成的复杂分布式系统的方法。在这些系统中，请求可能会经过多个服务，每个服务都负责执行特定的任务。因此，没有使用一些专用工具，跟踪请求的旅程可能会变得具有挑战性。</p>
<p>在探索分布式追踪之前，我们必须定义两个关键概念：追踪和跨度。一个追踪代表一个外部请求，由一组跨度组成。一个跨度代表一个操作；其关键属性是操作名称、开始时间和结束时间。一个跨度可以有一个或多个子跨度，代表嵌套操作。</p>`,r:{minutes:6.6,words:1980},t:"Brave简介",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/Introduction%20to%20DuckDB.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./Introduction to DuckDB.html-BDF4wj_r.js"),__vite__mapDeps([996,1])),meta:{d:17187552e5,l:"2024年6月19日",c:["Database","Java"],g:["DuckDB","SQL","CSV","JSON"],e:`

<p>让我们首先描述第一种方法。</p>
<h3>2. 使用replaceAll()中的后向引用</h3>
<p>要理解后向引用，我们首先需要了解匹配组。简单来说，一个组不过是将多个字符视为一个单元。因此，后向引用是正则表达式中的一个特性，它允许我们在同一个正则表达式中引用先前匹配的组。通常，我们使用数字来表示模式中的捕获组，如\\1、\\2等。</p>

<h2>2. 理论背景</h2>
<p>在Java中，我们有一个密钥库的概念。它本质上是一个包含一些秘密的文件。特别是，它可以包含证书链以及相应的私钥。由于证书只是一个花哨的公钥包装器，我们可以基本上说密钥库包含一个非对称密钥对。</p>
<p>通常，用密码（也通常称为“口令”）保护我们的私钥是一个好习惯。这不仅是Java密钥库中的好习惯，也是网络安全的一般做法。通常通过使用对称密钥加密算法（如各种AES实例）使用密码加密私钥来实现这种保护。</p>`,r:{minutes:5.96,words:1787},t:"解决安全异常：java.security.UnrecoverableKeyException：无法恢复密钥 | Baeldung",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/Return%20Non-null%20Elements%20From%20Java%20Map%20Operation.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./Return Non-null Elements From Java Map Operation.html-PvWlDRdw.js"),__vite__mapDeps([1026,1])),meta:{d:17183232e5,l:"2024年6月14日",c:["Java","Programming"],g:["Java Stream API","map","filter","Optional"],e:`

<h2>2. 问题介绍</h2>
<p>map()方法提供了一个高层次的抽象，用于处理元素序列。它是一个中间操作，将映射函数应用于Stream的每个元素，生成一个新的转换后的元素Stream。</p>

<h3>2. 理解测试注解</h3>
<p>在开始代码示例之前，让我们快速看一下一些测试注解的基础知识。</p>
<p>首先，Mockito最常用的@Mock注解为测试创建了一个依赖项的模拟实例。<strong>它经常与@InjectMocks结合使用，后者将标记有@Mock的模拟注入到正在测试的目标对象中。</strong></p>
<p>除了Mockito的注解，Spring Boot的注解@MockBean可以帮助创建一个模拟的Spring bean。然后，模拟的bean可以被上下文中的其他bean使用。<strong>此外，如果Spring上下文自己创建了可以在不模拟的情况下使用的bean，我们可以使用@Autowired注解来注入它们。</strong></p>`,r:{minutes:6.35,words:1904},t:"使用Spring Boot测试中的@Autowired和@InjectMocks | Baeldung",y:"a"}}],["/posts/baeldung/Archive/Using%20Comparator.nullsLast()%20to%20Avoid%20NullPointerException%20When%20Sorting.html",{loader:()=>a(()=>import("./Using Comparator.nullsLast() to Avoid NullPointerException When Sorting.html-NXVJsK_w.js"),__vite__mapDeps([1038,1])),meta:{d:17182368e5,l:"2024年6月13日",c:["Java","Comparator"],g:["Java 8","Sorting","NullPointerException"],e:`
